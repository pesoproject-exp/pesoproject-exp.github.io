The Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS) exists to foster collaboration
across a diverse collection of Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs). Each SSO is charged
with stewarding and advancing a portion of the scientific software ecosystem, e.g., math
libraries, data and viz libraries and tools, and programming systems. CASS is established to
define and execute a governance model and related processes that enable the SSOs to operate as
an aggregate unit.
