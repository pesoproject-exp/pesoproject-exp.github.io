## 2024 CASS Community BOF Days
### June 11-13, 2024

We are pleased to announce the **2024 CASS Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days**, led by the newly established _Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS)_ and hosted by the _Partnering for Scientific Software Ecosystem Stewardship_ (PESO) project.  This event builds on the ECP Community BOF Days, hosted by the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) during 2021â€“2023. 

 CASS Community BOF Days enable the high-performance computing community to engage with scientific software teams to discuss their latest development efforts.  Each of the 2024 BOF sessions on a given topic will last from 60 to 90 minutes and include a brief overview and a Q&A. We will use Zoom to conduct the BOFs.

 **Please note:** 
 - CASS will not host a BOF session at 1 pm ET on Wednesday, June 12. Instead, we bring to your attention the monthly HPC Best Practices Webinar and provide a direct link to the sign-up page for the webinar.
 - Each BOF has its own Zoom registration link.  Sign up for each BOF separately. 
 - If two BOFs are listed at the same time, they will run in parallel using separate Zoom sessions.
