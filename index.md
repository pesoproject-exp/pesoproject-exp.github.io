## CASS Overview

The Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS) exists to foster collaboration across a diverse collection of Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs).  Each SSO is charged with stewarding and advancing a portion of the scientific software ecosystem, e.g., math libraries, data and viz libraries and tools, and programming systems.  CASS is established to define and execute a governance model and related processes that enable the SSOs to operate as an aggregate unit.

## CASS Mission
Stewardship and advancement of the current and future ecosystem of scientific computing software.

## CASS Principles

- **Transparency:** open governance policies and open access to Consortium artifacts.
- **Diversity:** cultivation of diverse participation and representation.
- **Sustainability:** long-term viability and growth of software, practices, and workforce.
- **Innovation:** responsiveness to stakeholder needs and technological evolution.
- **Cooperation:** working together to support the overall Consortium mission.
- **Integrity:** acting as a fair, trusted, and respected asset to the community.

## CASS Organizational Model

The Consortium is a federation of member organizations committed to actively pursuing the stated
Mission and Goals collaboratively, following the stated Principles. Member organizations
exist to support specific communities or to provide crosscutting capabilities related to scientific
software stewardship. Member organizations coordinate and cooperate as a consortium to maximize
benefit to the ecosystem as a whole.

### Goals and Scope
In support of the mission and principles, in conjunction with its member organizations, the Consortium
will:
- **Deliver a capable, high-quality, interoperable software ecosystem for scientific computing:** By providing guidance with respect to software engineering best practices and standards; developing, promulgating, and applying assessment methods.
- **Build and retain a diverse, inclusive, and capable workforce equipped to carry out and lead scientific software stewardship and advancement activities:** By fostering a supportive and inclusive culture and applying best practices to broaden participation.
- **Engage a broad base of stakeholders:** By promoting the scientific software ecosystem, undertaking outreach activities to educate and engage, lowering barriers to engagement, and pursuing opportunities to broaden the impact of the Consortium.
- **Maintain open, two-way communication with stakeholders:** By speaking with a unified voice to stakeholders regarding status and direction and disseminating feedback to the Consortium.
- **Maximize the impact of Consortium resources and capabilities for the benefit of the ecosystem at large:** By improving efficiency by combining and coordinating infrastructure, planning, and resources across the ecosystem.
- **Maintain situational awareness and balanced coverage of the evolving needs of scientific computing:** By identifying gaps, incompatibilities, and other issues to be addressed in a coordinated fashion across the Consortium.
- **Ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the Consortium:** By exploring and executing plans for ensuring secure funding sources, including the growth of the Consortium through the expansion of membership.

### CASS Member Organizations

The initial member organizations (COLABS, [CORSA](https://corsa.center), [PESO](https://pesoproject.org), S4PST, [STEP](https://ascr-step.org) and [SWAS](https://swas.center), together with the [FASTMath](https://scidac5-fastmath.lbl.gov) and [RAPIDS](https://rapids.lbl.gov) SciDAC Institutes) have been supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research ([ASCR](https://science.osti.gov/ascr)) as part of the Next-Generation Scientific Software Technologies (NGSST) program to steward the ASCR scientific software portfolio, including products developed or enhanced as part of the Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org)) Software Technologies. As a member-driven organization, CASS is open to other software stewardship organizations joining too.
