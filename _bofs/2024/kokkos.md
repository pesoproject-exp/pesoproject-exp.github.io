## Kokkos Ecosystem - State of the Union

### Speakers
- Christian Trott, Sandia
- Damien Lebrun-Grandie, ORNL
- Siva Rajamanickam, Sandia
- Luc Berger-Vergiat, Sandia 

### Description
The Kokkos team will give an update on where the Kokkos Ecosystem stands after the end of ECP. The team will provide insight into the evolution of the developer community, new capabilities recently added and planned for the near future, as well as Kokkos' move to the Linux Foundation.
The new capabilities include the step-wise support for multiple GPUs within the same process, new Ecosystem efforts for seamless MPI and FFT support, and explicit improvements to leverage systems with tightly integrated GPUs and CPUs, such as NVIDIA's Grace-Hopper system and AMD's MI300A APU. Joining the Linux Foundation provides further opportunities to grow the Kokkos community through a clearly defined governance model that enables true multi-institutional development teams. The BoF will also provide ample time to further address community questions.
