## CASS Overview

The Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS) exists to foster collaboration across a diverse collection of Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs).  Each SSO is charged with stewarding and advancing a portion of the scientific software ecosystem, e.g., math libraries, data and viz libraries and tools, and programming systems.  CASS is established to estabish governance model, processes, and commitments that enable the SSOs to operate as an aggregate unit.

## CASS Mission
Stewardship and advancement of the current and future ecosystem of scientific computing software.

## CASS Principles

- **Transparency:** open governance policies and open access to Consortium artifacts.
- **Diversity:** cultivation of diverse participation and representation.
- **Sustainability:** long-term viability and growth of software, practices, and workforce.
- **Innovation:** responsiveness to stakeholder needs and technological evolution.
- **Cooperation:** working together to support the overall Consortium mission.
- **Integrity:** acting as a fair, trusted, and respected asset to the community.

## CASS Organizational Model

The Consortium is a federation of member organizations committed to actively pursuing the stated
Mission and Goals in a collaborative fashion, following the stated Principles. Member organizations
exist to support specific communities or to provide crosscutting capabilities related to scientific
software stewardship. Member organizations coordinate and cooperate as a consortium to maximize
benefit to the ecosystem as a whole.

### Goals and Scope
In support of the mission and principles, in conjunction with its member organizations, the Consortium
will:
- **Deliver a capable, high-quality, interoperable software ecosystem for scientific computing:** By providing guidance with respect to software engineering best practices and standards; developing, promulgating, and applying assessment methods.
- **Build and retain a diverse, inclusive, and capable workforce equipped to carry out and lead scientific software stewardship and advancement activities:** By fostering a supportive and inclusive culture and applying best practices to broaden participation.
- **Engage a wide base of stakeholders:** By promoting the scientific software ecosystem, undertaking outreach activities to educate and engage, lowering barriers to engagement, and pursuing opportunities to broaden the impact of the Consortium.
- **Maintain open, two-way communication with stakeholders:** By speaking with a unified voice to stakeholders regarding status and direction, and disseminating feedback to the Consortium.
- **Maximize the impact of Consortium resources and capabilities for the benefit of the ecosystem at large:** By improving efficiency by combining and coordinating infrastructure, planning, and resources across the ecosystem.
- **Maintain situational awareness and balanced coverage of the evolving needs of scientific computing:** By identifying gaps, incompatibilities, and other issues to be addressed in a coordinated fashion across the Consortium.
- **Ensure the long term viability and sustainability of the Consortium:** By exploring and executing plans for ensuring secure funding sources, including growth of the Consortium through the expansion of membership.
